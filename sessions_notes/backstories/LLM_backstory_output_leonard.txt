Wears rough work clothes and armor marked with the BattleWagons/ShieldWagons crest. Heavy scars from battles and failed experiments. Carries a fragment of a golden nuggetâ€”a relic from his past. Skilled in magical/mechanical tinkering, quick learner, but low charisma and sometimes reckless curiosity. Proud but respectful. Orphaned as an infant from a flying ship wreckage (parents Elias & Maren Goldwright, artificers, killed by a dragon attack near Dragonlands after their friend Ethan Blackwood/Zha''thik, a demon spy, was involved). Raised by the ShieldWagons mercenary group (leader Garrick Shieldheart, combat mentor Thorne Ironfist, friends Ryn & Kael). Discovered tinkering abilities disarming a magical trap. Left ShieldWagons after Kael betrayed him, stealing the golden nugget (artifact from his parents) after Ryn''s death. Tracked Kael to Byriver. Short-term goal: Learn to sail a flyship, find tinkering mentor. Long-term: Build own flying workshop, uncover secrets of the golden nugget and his past.'

-- Corrected approach for relation 73: Describe in Garrick's character_description or link Garrick to an Event representing ShieldWagons activities.
-- For now, I will remove relation 73 and assume Garrick's leadership is part of his description. If a "ShieldWagons" entity (e.g. as an Event or placeholder Character) were created, this could be a valid relation.
-- For the purpose of this exercise, I will assume the group "ShieldWagons" is context for characters rather than a linkable entity to avoid schema error.
-- The connection of characters to ShieldWagons is established through their descriptions and their relationships to Garrick/Thorne.
