sessions 1
The adventure started with the 3 heroes - [[Vince]], [[Stella]], and [[Leonard]], getting recruited by one of [[tLoB]]'s officers, to try and find a solution to [[Haldrix]], ideally before he arrives in 3 days time to wreck havoc on [[Byriver]]

[[Chapters/Haldrix's Terror/The Party|The Party]] headed out south([[CN]]), the direction Haldrix was seen flying towards, and the direction the direction of the [[Ahallona]] temple where the city was to pool the gold at.

session 2
[[Chapters/Haldrix's Terror/The Party|The Party]] , after a day of hiking in the mountains and a short fight with a Giant, they arrive at the ruined shrine.
In the shrine, [[Leonard]] found and identified an [[Amulet of Fire Absorption]]
The Party decided to setup an ambush for [[Haldrix]], and managed to get the jump on him, weakening him before he fled towards [[Byriver]]

session 3
The Party decided to rush back towards the city, and on the way back managed to find some weird steamy caverns that had a shape of a skull in the entrance.
After a bit of scouting, The Party decided to enter, and encountered a lair of Giants, seemingly tinkering with traps and riding equipment and a steam generator.

After dismantling the steam generator and taking out the 5 Giants in the lair, The Party unlocked the door to Haldrix's room, and after fighting him and weakening him slightly more, he flew to the city.

The Party found some gliders and used them to reach the city quickly, and upon arrival they saw Haldrix was already terrorizing the place.

Between finding & rescuing the Ballista Crew, helping travelling performers who had some fireworks, and locating a local oddities trader that might have potentially useful equipment, The Party decided to help the performers and local the trader.

The Party, each equipped with a [[Potion of Invisibility]] they got from the rescued trader, snuck their way into the castle, while Haldrix was doing rounds to scorch the city.
Getting to the roof of the castle, The Party initiated a fight with Haldrix, and the rescued performers used their fireworks to stun Haldrix and keep him from flying.

The Party, mostly due to Stella's handy-work, dismantled Haldrix very quickly, saving the city and earning them the title of "The Heroes of [[Byriver]]"
