After saving [[Byriver]], [[Chapters/The Dragonsmith/The Party|The Party]] had some downtime to gear up and use [[Haldrix]]'s loot.

At the end of the month, they were summoned again by [[tLoB]], where they ran into [[Silva]] in the lords court

Silva told The Party about a rising draconic threat, with [[Haldrix]] being only a symptom, and that something, or someone, is breaking a long-held border treaty between the human races and [[The Dragon Kingdom]]
Also, there is a theory among scholars that some stones are used to accelerate the growth rate of newborn dragons, allowing for very quick development of new threats.

[[tLoB]] and Silva instruct The Party to:
* Defeat as many overreaching dragons as they can.
* Specifically, chase down [[The Black Skeledragon]] - A dragon that is half black, and half skeleton dragon, with a yellow pulsing gem in it's chest.
* Understand the source of the dragon-growing stones.
* Destroy the stones and stop their production
In total, Silva talks about 3 dragon attacks - one in [[Byriver]], and 2 in the south
One of the dragons caused storms according to Silva, and that the storms it caused affected a large surrounding area.

[[Vince]] managed to remember (but not share with anyone) that there was an ancient theory about dragons being a source of magic, that could "leak"
Dragons are creatures of innate natural magic, and if they "leak", and the stronger they do, the more their magic effects the area around them, caused potential natural calamity (such as storms)

Their brief is interrupted by a man, one of a 2-man party, asking for help, to get his family "out of their hell". The second person was taken into care by some guards.
He is taken to care as well, but on the way he gets aggressive, and attacks the party. 
His attacks spread some weird worms to [[Leonard]], and [[Stella]] burns the wound to kill the worms
[[Vince]] inspects the now-corpse, and finds that the worms are magic in nature, specifically Necrotic magic.
The Party deduces that person has become a zombie.

The Party books it to the other man from the village taken in, and finds he is a zombie as well, dispatching of him.
Now it's clear - whatever is going on in that "hell", is a plague (later known simply as the [[Necrotic Worm Plague]])
The Party reports the incidents to [[tLoB]] and Silva, and they request the party immediately send to the village, referenced as "Hell" - [[Faerie Whisper]]

Approaching the town, the entire area is covered in black miasma, that grows thicker and thicker as the party approaches the town.
Moreover, the town and area around it look worse than desolate - they look rotten.
Vince recognizes that this effect could be done by 3 potential types of dragons - Copper, Black, or a living Skeletal Dragon

This session ends with The Party's cart grinding to a halt, right at the edge of [[Boltan]], as 5 armed rotten-looking characters emerge from the ground and miasma, one of them carrying a spear and armor.
