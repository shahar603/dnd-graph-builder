[[Session 4]] ended with [[Chapters/The Dragon Designer/The Party|The Party]] facing off against a group of 4 lesser undead, and one armed and armored undead creature. Dark miasma covering the ground. 

Right as both sides were initiating combat, a goliath barbarian seemed to have appeared through a tear in reality.

Assessing the situation, the barbarian join forces with The Party, and later introduced himself as [[Granite]]. 
During the fight, a huge Necrotic Worm jumped out from one of the undead creatures, and latches into [[Stella]]'s neck. [[Leonard]] healed her, and they all moved forward to [[Boltan]]

[[Granite]] explains that, to the best of his knowledge, he just time traveled, unintentionally, with a contraption that is sort of a box with hourglasses on the sides, after he inserted a weird yellow gemstone into it. He decides to join The Party.
He also explains that of the things he remembers, is [[Nel]] Almador getting split down the middle with a huge beam of purple light, while a small elf kid was near her.
Furthermore, he remembers that same elf, with a lightning amulet, taking the same yellow stone from the contraption, attaching it to a big egg with runes inscribed on it, and suddenly the egg hatched into a small half black half skeleton dragon, and very quickly it grew to medium, then adult, then finally it turned into [[The Black Skeledragon]], and flew away from [[King's Stand]], with the same yellow stone stuck in its chest.
[[Vince]] recognizes that the purple flash that Granite mentioned was an event known as "The end of the dungeons and the fall of the gods"

On the edge of [[Boltan]], as The Party is about to reach it, Stella seems to get hit by something and fly off the cart. 
Suddenly, she starts transforming, her skin rotting, her usual light and starry aura turning dark and gloomy. 
At the end of the transformation, she stands up, no longer just a druid, but now a lich, who flies into the air in a huge pulse of necrotic energy.
[[Vince]] immediately recognizes the transformation that Stella underwent.
Saddened by the lose, The Party continues to Boltan.

They now also address the Tabaxi at the outskirts of the town, sitting up on a rock, licking his wounds.
He introduces himself as [[Eleca]], and also joins the party, offering his skills as a Warlock.

Leonard picks up on the fact that the villagers seem afraid of the party, and cautiously the party approaches the village.
Immediately, the party finds whoever currently is leading the survivors - [[Brox]] of [[Agrata]].
Agrata is also known as "The City in the Sky", and Brox is one of the airship pilots from the city, in Boltan on vacation.

Brox asks us to go to [[Aldor]], a nearby village, a few hours of riding away, to go search for survivors from the zombie attacks.
He also noted that Aldor has the workshop of Nel Almador, who is also his friend, and we should check the workshop.

Before the party departs, Leonard asks to check on the wounded, to try to aid them.
He is brought to [[Elay]] and [[Terry]], survivors from Aldor. They talked about losing from friends to zombie ogres.

Brox also mentions there there is a shield, that emitted from the temple in the graveyard, that is keeping the miasma and undead away from the city.
Vince decides to go investigate, and finds that the temple is devoted to [[Ahallona]].
The entire shrine is implanted into a large tree, and is in great shape for an old shrine.
Vince identifies that there are runes on the tombstones in the graveyard and the shrine itself.
There is also a white stone imbedded into the shrine which is emitting the shield.
The white stone itself has an Abjuration-typed magic on it, and the tombstone and shrine have Enchantment-typed magic on them, probably acting as sort of spell-conduits to increase the power of the stone.
After further inspection using the Identify spell, Vince understands that the stone is The Amulet of Ahallona - a magic item, emitting the protective shield around the town, and is getting weaker by the day.

After spending the night in the town, the party heads out to Aldor, after an hour of riding they see a Zombie Ogre and a pair of Ghouls on the road ahead of them.
